									<p>One of the biggest threats on the safety of the globe right now is atomic energy if used in the wrong purposes or ways. The highly destructive nuclear weapons are posessed by major countries. The usage of nuclear weapons are seen as the way the humankind might bring the end of their world by their own hands. Countries started leaning towards using atomic energy for electricity production and the rapidly increasing usage of atomic energy plants brings severe risks with them. The UN wanted to eliminate the risks born by the atomic energy usage and decided to take a further step on the issue so the IAEA was born. The International Atomic Energy Agency, the IAEA for short, is an international organisation that aims to promote the peaceful use of atomic energy and prevent its destructive and military purposed usage. The IAEA works with its 170 member states and worldwide partners to achieve its goal. It was established in 1957 as an autonomous organisation affiliated to the UN and the Security Council. The IAEA&#39s relationship to the UN is guided by an agreement signed by the both parties. Considering the catastrophic accidents which occured within the neglected use of atomic enegry plants such as Chernobyl and the posession of nuclear weapons by some states, the IAEA plays a big role on protecting the global peace. Through the Department of Nuclear Safety and Security, the IAEA works to provide a global nuclear safety and security framework in order to prevent the humanity&#39s not-so-proud history with atomic energy from repeating itself. Although the IAEA doesn&#39t have the mandate to enforce the applications of these safety standarts and frameworks, they still have important contributions on the protection of the people and the economy. If you want to work on a really important issue our world is facing right now, we would love to see you between us in this committee! </p>

									<p>The International Maritime Organization is a specialized agency of the United Nations which is responsible for measures to improve the safety and security of international shipping and to prevent pollution from ships. It is also involved in legal matters, including liability and compensation issues and the facilitation of international maritime traffic.

									<br>

									<p>It currently has 174 Member States. IMO's governing body is the Assembly which is made up of all the Member States and meets normally once every two years. It adopts the budget for the next biennium together with technical resolutions and recommendations prepared by subsidiary bodies during the previous two years. The Council, of 40 Member States elected by the Assembly, acts as governing body in between Assembly sessions. It prepares the budget and work programme for the Assembly. The main technical work is carried out by the Maritime Safety, Marine Environment Protection, Legal, Technical Co-operation and Facilitation Committees and a number of sub-committees. </p>

									<p>The United Nations Security Council Counter-Terrorism Committee was established by Security Council in the wake of the 11 September terrorist attacks in the United States. The Committee prevents giving financial support to terrorist groups and providing safe places for terrorist groups to gather, shares information about terrorist groups with other governments, cooperates with other governments to investigate and arrest people involved in terrorism and put them on trial, makes laws against assisting terrorists in any way and put people who violate these laws on trial. The Committee is composed of 15 Member States: Bolivia, China, C&ocirc;te d&#39Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, France, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Netherlands, Peru, Poland, Russian Federation, Sweden, United Kingdom, United States. The committee must work with countries, organizations and counter-terrorism experts in order to effectively fight terrorism. It must also focus on a wide range of issues, from keeping money and weapons out of the hands of terrorists to being sure that the fight against terrorism does not violate human rights. The CTC must address all of these diverse issues if it wants to effectively combat terrorism. The problems need to be resolved now! Come and join us!

									<p>The International Criminal Police Organization, more commonly known as Interpol, is the international organization that facilitates international police cooperation which was established before the United Nations. INTERPOL was established in Vienna, Austria on the initiative of Dr. Johannes Schober, president of the Vienna police. The idea behind INTERPOL was first discussed during an international police conference in Monaco. There were 24 countries present. Since the day it was established, it kept growing and today, there are 190 different countries linked together through INTERPOL and it is the only police organization that spans the entire globe. INTERPOL&#39s main purpose is to enable the world police to ensure the safety of the human beings all over the world and its primary role is to assist law enforcement agencies around the world in combating all forms of transnational crime and terrorism. INTERPOL is not commonly used in MUN conferences, even though it is a committee with great potential. Delegates of this committee are going to run an operation against the world's most dangerous drug cartel, the Cali Cartel, and try to take them down. Also, they are going to struggle with unexpected crises and try to solve them. Are you brave enough to catch the Cali Cartel? Are you clever enough to make strategic moves against them? Come and prove that, we are waiting for you! </p>

What would be its obligations to citizens, and most importantly, what checks on its power could be put in place in order to prevent another form of tyranny from rising? </p>
