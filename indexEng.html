  <p  class="baslik2">About Me</p>
  <p class="metin2">&nbsp; &nbsp;Hello, my name is Ömer Tarık İnce (as known as ÖTİ). I was born on 13th of December, 2002 in Kadıköy. In this article, I will try to introduce myself and describe ÖTİ as a social being. And of course I will talk about my educational background. <br></p>
<p class="metin2">&nbsp; &nbsp;Before I enrolled in Haydarpaşa, my former high school, I hesitated on joining activities that took part around me and I could't take any responsibilities on my own. However, I was known as a "Hardworking Kid". In time my "hardworking" trait started to shift from an educational success to a prosperity in my social life and social clubs I join. But my parents never doubted me and they kept supporting me however they can. <br></p>
<p class="metin2">&nbsp; &nbsp;In my Freshman year I joined my schools Handball team. And I played Handball with them for 2 years. But I was just a mere substitute, a benchwarmer in my team. Later that year I joined my schools MUN club as an IT member. It was a stepping stone to my future accomplishments but I didn't know it yet. In my second year working as an IT member for my schools MUN club, I was promoted to Deputy Head of IT. With this promotion I started taking care of more footwork such as backstage equipments and technical difficulties. <br></p>
<p class="metin2">&nbsp; &nbsp;The summer between 9th and 10th grade I got my first electric guitar and started jamming to some sweet sweet tunes. Me and my friends started a band later that year so I got to improve myself as a musician. Speaking of music I would like to tell you a bit about my musical tastes. My 3 favorite genres are metal (most kinds of it), rock (all kinds of it) and blues. In my years as an high school student I got the chance to deepen my music taste a lot. I started listening to classical music, smooth jazz and old school hip-hop and old school pop. <br></p>
<p class="metin2">&nbsp; &nbsp;My education life got more exciting and tiring in 10th grade to be exact, I was eager to take some responsibilites. And all my eagerness started with an Instagram post. They wanted a post about the club made so I jumped in, I said I could do it. But I could not. Because I did not know my way around photo editing software and social media. But former Head of Media and my Vice Principal saw a spark in me. So they wanted me to enroll in a Photoshop course which was taking place in our school. This ignited a big flame which drives me even today as a passionate designer/aesthete. For that I am grateful. After all that I joined the management team of the first annual Sportfest as a designer. I worked over 40 projects (%87.5 of them was used) and I met many wonderful people that year. But the workload got so overwhelming so I quit the band, even though I was one of the founders. <br></p>
<p class="metin2">&nbsp; &nbsp;After the HPALMUN'2019 passed I was promoted to Head of the IT team. <br></p>
<p class="metin2">&nbsp; &nbsp;My 10th grade was so nurturing for me, I even got to learn a bit about the concept of entrepreneurship. In an entrepreneurship summit I attended with my friends, the idea of kick-starting an entrepreneurship club of our own school started to shape. And the whole idea got even bigger in my head when I attended IBPF'2018. I got assigned as a field attendant so I was reeled in a bit more. In the last weeks of 10th grade we established our very own Entrepreneurship Club. As all of this was happening the Sportfest came and passed and I got promoted to Head of Sportfest Media Team. <br></p>
<p class="metin2">&nbsp; &nbsp;The summer between 10th grade and 11th grade I was asked by my managers at HaydarpaşaMUN(HPALMUN changed its name) to create an info website about our club and this year's annual HaydarpaşaMUN. So I started to learn basics of site design and learning the coding languages required to shape a site on my own. I took notes in my summerhouse without a pc. Website was ready for the school's opening days. (<a class="siteH" href="haydarpasamun/index.html" target="_blank">Haydarpaşa MUN 2019 Website</a>)<br></p>
<p class="metin2">&nbsp; &nbsp;In 11th grade I was Sportfest Media Head, Founding Director of the Entrepreneurship Club and Head of the IT department. I've overcome a lot of difficulties for HaydarpaşaMUN, dealt with assignments for Sportfest and then I gave all my attention to our Entrepreneurship Club. While we were kick-starting our Entrepreneurship Club, hosting many events and getting ready for our first summit, people were negative about our works. They kept saying that it was nearly impossible for us to host a decent summit in our club's first year. But it wasn't an obstacle for us and we kept working for it. As I said we attended to many activities with our club such as taking a nurturing class from INOVATIM. As the biggest event of the year approached day by day our school's education foundation and it's president Mr. Emin Baş helped us a lot. Mehmet Ali Aydınlar, the founder of the ACIBADEM GROUP, who presented Turkey in EY Entrepneur of The year  were our guest of honor in our  summit. We hosted estimable entrepreneurs and influencers in first Haydarpaşa High school Entrepreneurship Summit. (<a class="siteH" href="hlgirisimcilik/index.html"target="_blank">Haydarpaşa Lisesi Entrepreneurship Summit 2019 Website</a>)<br></p>
<p class="metin2">&nbsp; &nbsp;My 12th grade was going great as I was studying for my University exam until the pandemic happenned. I had our school's first live interview with Halıcı Group's CEO, Dr.Hüseyin Halıcı, in quarantine. The events that took place in quarantine really wore me down and I lost my focus. The whole exam process started to feel pointless as it was merely a false reflection of oneself. After the exam results came in I chose to study Environmental Engineering in Istanbul Technical University. I'll update when the placements are due.In this section I want to talk more about what I have done so I will not talk about my university dreams but the last 4 years speaks for itself.(Last update date 21.08.2020)<br></p>

          I learned to use photoshop in 2018 and i’m using photoshop since 2018. I prefer not to exhibit my work such as posters and instagram posts that I made for Haydarpaşa High School because I do not find it enough to put my amateur photoshop works on this site. Instead, I decided to exhibit a series of famous art portraits with my renditions on this site.
